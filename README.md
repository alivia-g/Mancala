### About Mancala
[Classic Mancala Instruction](https://endlessgames.com/wp-content/uploads/Mancala_Instructions.pdf)

Mancala is one of the oldest known games to still be widely played today. Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces. (Versions of the game date back to the 7th century and evidence suggests the game existed in ancient Egypt!)
